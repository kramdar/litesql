LiteSQL 0.3.5 - C++ Object-Relational Persistence Framework
-----------------------------------------------------------
LiteSQL is a C++ library that integrates C++ objects tightly to relational
database and thus provides an object persistence layer. LiteSQL supports
SQLite3, PostgreSQL and MySQL as backends. LiteSQL creates tables, 
indexes and sequences to database and upgrades schema when needed. 

In addition to object persistence, LiteSQL provides object relations which
can be used to model any kind of C++ data structures. Objects can be selected,
filtered and ordered using template- and class-based API with type 
checking at compile time.

See HTML documentation for details docs/html/index.html.
