\section ver0_3_2 Version 0.3.2
2006 January 25th:
- feature: static FieldType-objects for subclasses' id fields are now named Class::Own::Id so that they can be used in template methods
- bug fix: litesql-gen compiles again with g++ 4.0 (explicit template specialization was missing)

2006 January 21th:
- feature: litesql-gen writes static FieldType - objects for subclasses' id fields
- bug fix: litesql-gen wrote broken RelationHandle::del - method. It deleted all rows.
- bug fix: SQLite3-backend transaction reset not needed in case of an error

2006 January 20th:
- bug fix: Date-, DateTime- and Time-fields were broken. 
- bug fix: litesql-gen wrote invalid default values for Date-, DateTime and Time-fields. 
- bug fix: litesql-gen did not reset fields' modified flags when assigning record to object

2006 January 19th:
- bug fix: MySQL 5 does not like names like 'schema' and 'sql'. Internal table is now named to 'schema_' and fields are postfixed with an underscore. This breaks compatibility with databases created with previous versions. 

2006 January 16th:
- bug fix: litesql-gen did not create correct SQL schema for backends with auto incrementing primary key fields (mysql, sqlite3)
- bug fix: SQLite3 - backend did not reset transaction state when error occurred
- litesql-gen writes #ifndef #define #endif - checks to generated header now


2006 January 14th:
- bug fix: litesql-gen did not sort objects of relation tags and this resulted to broken relation table names

2006 January 3rd:
- bug fix: litesql-gen writes explicit template parameters for make_pair now (gcc 2.96 requires it)

2005 December 25th:
- bug fix: all backend transaction routines leaked some memory (fixed by Michel Loiseleur)
- bug fix: litesql-gen crashed when XML file had undefined objects inside relation tag
- litesql-config utility and pkg-config support added (by Eric McDonald)
- bug fix: litesql-gen produced broken table names when using longer name than 31 characters
- bug fix: litesql-gen produced broken SQL (duplicated relation attribute fields in CREATE TABLE - statements)
- RPM packaging headers (by Eric McDonald)
- added .cvsignore - files (by Eric McDonald)
- versioning and packaging improvements (by Eric McDonald)
- litesql-gen : internal restructuring

\section ver0_3_1 Version 0.3.1
- namespace - attribute is required now on (used in litesql-gen)
- relation field type names are now consistent with object field type names (they start with uppercase letter) 
- bug fix: litesql-gen rejected relations with two or more objects with no relation handles (duplicate handle)
- better tests for backend databases to configure.ac (by Eric McDonald) 

\section ver0_3_0 Version 0.3.0
- anonymous enums removed from enumerated field values (in generated code), compiles now with g++-4.0
- Relation::Row-class added, represents rows of relation table
- Relation::getRows-method added, used to access relation rows
- concurrency problem with SQLite3-backend.execute fixed
- few VC++ - compilation issues fixed (by Axel Schmidt)

- RelationHandle::getRows-method added, used to access relation rows linked to particular object
- configure-script added (uses autoconf and automake)
- scons dependencies removed
- Python dependencies removed
- debian packaging headers added
- graphviz - target added to litesql-gen
- date-, time-, datetime- and boolean- types added 
\section ver0_2 Version 0.2
