\section codegenerator Code Generator litesql-gen

LiteSQL uses XML database definition file which is used to generate
Persistent and Relation classes. 

The example database definition file (exampledatabase.xml)
page will result in two files (exampledatabase.hpp and testdatabase.cpp)
when fed to code generator. 
\include exampledatabase.xml
exampledatabase.hpp contains class declarations for persistent objects and 
relations
\include exampledatabase.hpp
exampledatabase.cpp contains implementation of methods and lots of static data.
\include exampledatabase.cpp

\section mappingtodatabase Mapping Objects to Relational Database

Fields of multiple Persistent-classes are stored in separate tables. 
Each Persistent-class has its own table. Also, each relation is stored in 
separate table. An example database demonstrates data mapping.
\code
<database name="example">
    <object name="Playable">
        <field name="name" type="string"/>
        <method name="play"/>
    </object>
    <object name="AudioFile" inherits="Playable">
        <field name="file" type="string"/>
        <method name="play"/>
    </object>
    <object name="Collection">
        <field name="description" type="string"/>
    </object>
    <relation>
        <relate object="AudioFile" handle="collections"/>
        <relate object="Collection" handle="files"/>
        <field name="percent" type="integer" default="100"/> 
    </relation>
</database>
\endcode
The database schema extracted from definitions above is similar to following:
\code
CREATE TABLE Playable_ (id_ INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, type_ TEXT, name_ TEXT);
CREATE TABLE AudioFile_ (id_ INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, file_ TEXT);
CREATE TABLE Collection_ (id_ INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, type_ TEXT, description_ TEXT);
CREATE TABLE AudioFile_Collection_ (AudioFile1 INTEGER, Collection2 INTEGER, percent_ INTEGER);

-- original name: idx_AudioFile_Collection_AudioFile1
CREATE INDEX _71b11d59ca507479edd464e053cd01 ON AudioFile_Collection_1 (AudioFile1); 

-- original name: idx_AudioFile_Collection_Collection2
CREATE INDEX _e1305d9ca2d1c6947b38fc301ad676 ON AudioFile_Collection_1 (Collection2); 

-- original name: idx_AudioFile_Collection_AudioFile1_Collection2
CREATE INDEX _7e632b2ede1b6f3348d36e44e443d0 ON AudioFile_Collection_1 (AudioFile1,Collection2); 
\endcode

The relation table AudioFile_Collection_1 is indexed by both of its fields.
If table or index identifier is longer than 31 characters, it will be 
truncated by calculating MD5-sum of the identifier because all backends do not
support longer identifiers (certain PostgreSQL - versions at least).

Fields in tables of Persistent classes and relation attributes 
(extra fields in relation tables) are postfixed with an underscore to 
allow usage of SQL's reserved words in identifiers. 

\section virtualmethods Virtual Methods

Using database defined in previous section, suppose one needs to select
a Playable from database and play() it. The routine selecting and playing
the Playable cannot know the actual type of the Playable. 

After Playable-object is selected from database it really is a Playable 
despite it was stored as an AudioFile for example. 

In order to retrieve all fields that AudioFile has, the Playable object needs to
be upcasted. 
\code
AudioFile af(db);
af.name = "A good song";
af.file = "goodsong.mp3";
af.update();

Playable p = select<Playable>(db, Playable::name_() == "A good song").one()
// p has only one field: name

p.upcast().play();
// this executes actually select<AudioFile>(db, Playable::id_() == x).one().play();
\endcode

The code generator (litesql-gen) writes upcast-method that returns object of
correct type.

Sometimes extra fields that an inherited Persistent may have are not needed
when accessing virtual methods. It would be futile to execute SQL statements.
Another upcaster function is provided to help in this situation. 

For example, onDelete() - method that usually just deletes all relation links to
the object in question does not need any fields. del() - method that calls
onDelete() uses upcastCopy() to access onDelete() of inherited Persistent.

\code
// same Playable is selected as in above example
p.upcastCopy()->makeLogEntry(log)
\endcode

Note that upcastCopy will return a Persistent whose all fields are not retrieved
from database.
