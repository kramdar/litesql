/** \page cost Cost of Using LiteSQL

\section memoryoverhead Memory Overhead

Extra variables in each Persistent object instance:
- bool modified - flag in each field
- bool oldID - flag (used to track id - changes)
- bool inDatabase - flag
- Database* - pointer

\section performanceoverhead Performance Overhead

- one INSERT-SQL statement is required per inherited Persistent-class (deep class inheritance hierarchies cost)
- selection of objects needs joins 

\section codesizeoverhead Code Size Overhead

As demonstrated in \ref implementation, code generator
(litesql-gen) generates a lot of code. In addition to that, a part of that code
uses templates which will produce even more code. 

This is rarely a problem but worth to note when memory is tight.
