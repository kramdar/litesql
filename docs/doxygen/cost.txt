\section memoryoverhead Memory Overhead

I have not made accurate memory usage measures but sizeof reports that
Persistent with one field needs 104 bytes of memory on 32bit i586. Extra 
fields cost 12 bytes each. 

A relation handle uses 8 bytes of memory per Persistent object. 

\section performanceoverhead Performance Overhead

When Persistent object is created:
- it constructs a vector and equally many strings as there is fields
- pointers to Field-objects are inserted to vector.
- a pointer to Persistent is passed to each RelationHandle-object

Mapping class hierarchy to relational database is not cheap either.
When inserting data to database one INSERT-SQL statement is required per 
inherited Persistent-class. The biggest performance hit is selecting.
Selecting inherited Persistent-objects requires table joins. 

This topic will be researched with detail when the library
itself has reached stable and consistent functionality.

Until then, keep in mind that there is a price tag in each Persistent.
\section codesizeoverhead Code Size Overhead

As demonstrated in \ref implementation, database definition file parser 
(parsedb.py) generates a lot of code. In addition to that, a part of that code
uses templates which will produce even more code. 

This is rarely a problem but worth to note when memory is tight.
