- writing extensive unit testers 
- ensuring that library compiles on different platforms and compilers
- documenting
- methods for accessing information of objects, fields and relations run-time (reflectivity support)
- support for backend specific options/optimizations (for example triggers, stored procedures, different storage engines)
- chained relation handles: jack.children().friends().mother().get().all() 
- combined relation (objects): 
- select upcasted - method: selects group of objects and automatically upcasts them to correct type effectively (using select distinct type_ from X)
- update-, delete- and persistent related methods for relation row objects
