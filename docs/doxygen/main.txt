/** \mainpage LiteSQL - C++ Object-Relational Persistence Framework
\section intro Introduction

LiteSQL is a C++ library that integrates C++ objects tightly to relational
database and thus provides an object persistence layer. LiteSQL supports
SQLite3, PostgreSQL and MySQL as backends. LiteSQL creates tables, 
indexes and sequences to database and upgrades schema when needed. 

In addition to object persistence, LiteSQL provides object relations which
can be used to model any kind of C++ data structures. Objects can be selected,
filtered and ordered using template- and class-based API with type checking at 
compile time.
 
\section features Features

- SQLite3, PostgreSQL and MySQL - backend support
- object persistence layer with relation support
- automatic database schema creation and upgrading
- create complex SQL queries using compile time checked class API; minimizes need to write SQL query strings

\section status Status

- new features are being developed
- no Windows support yet
 
\section requirements Requirements

- fairly recent C++ compiler
- client library and header files for at least one backend: libsqlite3, libmysqlclient or libpq

\subsection optionalreqs Optional
- automake 1.9.6
- autoconf 2.61
- flexml 1.61 (to generate code generator ;)
- doxygen 1.5.1
- dpkg-buildpackage (to generate debian packages)

\section license License

This library is distributed under the terms of \ref bsdlicense

\section helpneeded Help Needed

All feedback concerning the library is welcome. 
If you want to advance the development of the library, you may contribute by:
- using the library in your projects 
- submitting bug reports or feature requests
- implementing new a feature (ask first if somebody is already working on it)
- testing if the library compiles and runs on your system
- making the library compile and run on your system
- writing usage examples

\section quickstart Quick Start

\subsection quickstart1 Step 1: Write XML-file which defines objects, fields, methods and relations in database.

Simple example database definition file exampledatabase.xml:
\include exampledatabase.xml
Figure of database (generated with graphviz and litesql-gen):
\image html exampledatabase.png

\subsection quickstart2 Step 2: Run Code Generator
\code
litesql-gen exampledatabase.xml
\endcode
Files exampledatabase.cpp and exampledatabase.hpp are written.

\subsection quickstart3 Step 3: Write Application Code
\include example.cpp

\subsection quickstart4 Step 4: Compile, Link and Execute
When executed, the example program will output following:
\include example_output.txt
Following SQL queries are executed under the hood. Most of the queries
are related to creating database schema and storing it to schema-table.
\include example_queries.txt
